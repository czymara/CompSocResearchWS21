# Research training I & II: Comparative social research with multi-level modelling in R

### Course Description

Social science research often deals with the influence of social contexts on the individual. In comparative research, context is often understood as the country. For example: Does a nationalist election campaign jeopardize support for the welfare state? Why do people in some countries trust the police more than in others? Does income inequality lead to depression?

The course aims to provide students with the skills to carry out their own country comparison study. For this purpose, data from the European Social Survey (ESS) will be analyzed using the programming language R. *This is an advanced methods course - basic statistical knowledge, knowledge of data analysis (e.g. with R or Stata), and a general interest in quantitative research are required.* At the end of the course, students will conduct their own empirical-quantitative, country-comparative study in which they apply what they have learned during the semester to a topic of their choice.

This research training was originally conducted at Goethe University Frankfurt during the winter term of 2021/22 but is now openly accessible to anyone. Most sessions include a 90-minute lecture followed by a 90-minute exercise, ensuring a balanced blend of theoretical knowledge and practical application. For the original course, also see the course [Syllabus](https://github.com/czymara/CompSocResearchWS21/blob/main/FoP_VerglSozForsch_WiSe2122.pdf).
